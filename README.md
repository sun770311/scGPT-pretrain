## Large Language Models
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is a branch of artificial intelligence that creates real-world text, images, music, and other forms of media.

A large language model (LLM), such as GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), is a type of generative artificial intelligence model. LLM learns from extensive data sets how to process and generate natural language for tasks such as translation and conversation.
